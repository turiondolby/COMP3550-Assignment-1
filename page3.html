						<p>Everyone knows that dirty water can make you sick but most of you do not know the different ways polluted water can make you ill.</p>
					</p>
					<br/>
					<img src="IMG/waterbornediseases.jpg" alt="problem-woman" class="pull-left pic_pad"/>
					<p>Some of harmful and dangerous effects are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>It can make you very sick.</li>
						<li>It causes vomiting and diarrhea.</li>
						<li>It sometimes causes harmful skin rashes, which are very uncomfortable. </li>
						<li>For some adults or children, it causes cancer.  (Some kind of cancer, like leukemia, can happen after drinking bad water for a long period of time)</li>
						<li>Developmental problems.  (Some kind of learning disabilities can happen after drinking dirty water for a long period of time).</li>

					<h3>Microorganisms, Bacteria and Virus</h3>

					<img class="right_side_pics pull-right" src="IMG/index.jpg" alt="Consequences"/> 

					<p>Microbiological contamination of water has long been a concern to the public. And with the harmful effects and consequences, of not sanitizing water, it could get worse, in time to come.</p>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<h4>Coliform Bacteria:</h4>
					<img class="pull-right table_pic pic_pad" src="IMG/coliform_bacteria.jpg" alt="coliform_bacteria"/> 
					<p>Coliform bacteria live in soil or vegetation and in the gastrointestinal tract of animals.  Coliform enters through water supplies from the direct disposal of water into streams or lakes.  In addition, Coliform can enter an individual house via backflow of water from contaminated source.</p>
					<p>Coliforms are not a single type of bacteria, but a grouping of bacteria that includes many strains, such as E. coli. They are ubiquitous in nature, and many types are harmless. Therefore, it is not definitive that coliform bacteria will cause sickness. Many variables such as the specific type of bacteria present, and your own immune system's effectiveness will determine if you will get sick. In fact, many people become immune to bacteria that are present in their own water. Guests on the other hand, may not have developed immunity to the water and may experience some gastrointestinal distress such as diarrhea or gastroenteritis.</p>
					<br/>
					<h4>Cryptosporidium:</h4>
					<p>Cryptosporidium parvum is a protozoan parasite that causes cryptosporidiosis. Cryptosporidium is spread by the transmission of oocysts via drinking water which has been contaminated with infected fecal material.  Oocysts from humans are infective to humans and many other mammals, and many animals act as reservoirs of oocysts which can infect humans. Once inside of its host, the oocyst breaks, releasing four movable spores that attach to the walls of the gastrointestinal tract, and eventually form oocysts again that can be excreted. </p>
					<p>Symptoms occur 2 to 10 days after infection. These symptoms include diarrhea, headache, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, and a low fever. There is no treatment against the protozoa, although it is possible to treat the symptoms. After about 1-2 weeks, the symptoms subside as the immune system stops the infection. However, for persons with a compromised immune system such as infants, seniors, those with AIDS, or transplantees, cryptosporidiosis may become life threatening.</p>
					<br/>
					<h4>Giardia Lamblia:</h4>
					<img class="pull-right table_pic pic_pad" src="IMG/Giardia_lamblia.jpg" alt="Giardia_lamblia"/> 
					<p>Giardia is flagellated protozoa that are parasitic in the intestines of humans and animals. They have two stages, one of which is a cyst form that can be ingested from contaminated water. Once the cyst enters the stomach, the organism is released into the gastrointestinal tract where it will adhere to the intestinal wall. Eventually the protozoa will move into the large intestine where they encyst again and are excreted in the faeces and back into the environment.</p>
					<p>Once in the body, the giardia causes giardiasis, a disease characterized by symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea, weight loss, and general gastrointestinal distress. These symptoms last for about a week; however some people can undergo a more chronic infection with similar symptoms and an even greater degree of weight loss. Giardiasis is rarely fatal, and can be treated medicinally by quinacrine, metronidazole, and furazolidone.</p>
					<br/>
					<h4>Hepatitis A:</h4>
					<p>Hepatitis A is an enteric virus that is very small. It can be transferred through contaminated water, causing outbreaks. The virus is excreted by a person carrying it, and if the sewage contaminates the water supply, then the virus is carried in the water until it is consumed by a host. Symptoms such as an inflamed liver, accompanied by lassitude, anorexia, weakness, nausea, fever and jaundice are common. A mild case may only require a week or two of rest, while a severe case can result in liver damage and possible death. </p>
					<br/>
					<h4>Helminths:</h4>
					<img class="pull-right table_pic pic_pad" src="IMG/Parasite-helminths.jpg" alt="Parasite-helminths"/> 
					<p>Helminths are parasitic worms that grow and multiply in sewage and wet soil. They enter the body by burrowing through the skin, or by ingestion of the worm in one of its many lifecycle phases. The eggs as well as the adult and larval forms of the worms are large enough to be trapped during conventional water treatments, so they tend not be a problem in water systems. In addition, most of these helminths are not waterborne, so chances of infection are minimized. </p>
